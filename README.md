# Credit Card Churn Analysis - Bank "ForU"

## Overview
This project analyzes credit card customer churn patterns at Bank "ForU" to identify factors contributing to customer attrition and develop targeted retention strategies. The analysis is based on a Kaggle dataset of 10,000 random customers with 23 different variables including demographic, behavioral, and financial metrics.

## Key Findings
- Overall churn rate: 16.1% of customers in the dataset
- Statistically significant factors affecting churn:
  - Gender: Women show higher churn rates than men
  - Number of products: Customers with fewer products are more likely to churn
  - Credit limit: Lower credit limits correlate with higher churn rates
  - Transaction patterns: Lower transaction amounts and frequencies indicate higher churn risk
  - Customer activity: Extended periods of inactivity strongly correlate with churn
  - Bank contact: More frequent customer contacts with the bank indicate higher churn risk

## Dataset Details
The analysis includes 23 variables covering:
- Demographics (age, gender, marital status)
- Financial metrics (income, credit limit)
- Behavioral data (card usage, inactive months)
- Product information (card type, number of products)
- Transaction history (amounts, frequencies)

Data source: Kaggle Credit Card Customers Dataset

## Methodology
- Statistical analysis of customer attributes
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Causal relationship mapping using Hierarchical Bayesian Network
- Customer segmentation based on risk factors

## Key Recommendations
1. **Activity Encouragement Programs**
   - Develop programs to encourage credit card usage
   - Create targeted promotions for inactive customers

2. **Personalized Services**
   - Customize services based on customer needs
   - Implement personalized product recommendations

3. **Customer Engagement**
   - Improve customer service availability
   - Develop additional business relationships
   - Establish loyalty programs for existing customers

4. **Monitoring System**
   - Implement real-time analysis for identifying high-risk customers
   - Create early warning systems for churn prevention

## Future Work
1. Expand the analysis with a larger sample size
2. Conduct customer satisfaction surveys
3. Investigate combined effects of multiple variables on churn probability
4. Develop predictive models for early churn detection
